## Bauxite

Bauxite is not only an ore but it's a small town caught between 2 rival school districts. Taylor lives in the rival school district. Many families have kids in both of these school districts so I thought instead of creating a Salt Bowl, I'd name this project after Bauxite which Reynolds Road cuts through while driving to Benton.

### Laravel 5.6

Bauxite is built to work with 5.6.


### Introduction

Bauxite is a port of Laravel Boilerplate.
[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/rappasoft/laravel-5-boilerplate/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/rappasoft/laravel-5-boilerplate)


Bauxite adds a modular approach on top of what Laravel Boilerplate provides.

Laravel Boilerplate you with a massive head start on any size web application. It comes with a full featured access control system out of the box with an easy to learn API and is built on a Twitter Bootstrap foundation with a front and backend architecture. We have put a lot of work into it and we hope it serves you well and saves you time!

Anthony Rappa did a great job with Laravel Boilerplate but we wanted something that is module and would allow the ability to add modules. Obviously, if you don't link modules, I highly recommend to go with Boilerplate!
